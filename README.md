## Development

### Using Knex CLI

If you want to use the Knex CLI, you have to enter the container first. You can do that with the following command:

```bash
docker exec -it um_back /bin/sh
```

After that, you just have to install it globally with `npm i knex -g` and you can use it as you would normally do.
